# Pythagorean Lab

An interactive Pythagorean theorem simulator built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS** and **SVG**.

## Features

- **Draggable right triangle** – drag vertex **A** to change side *b*, vertex **B** to change side *a*, or the
  right-angle vertex **C** to swing it around the hypotenuse along its Thales circle. The angle at C is
  always exactly 90°. Vertices are also keyboard-accessible (arrow keys, Shift for bigger steps).
- **Sliders** for sides *a* and *b* (1–15, 0.01 precision) plus ± nudge buttons.
- **Live formula** – `a² + b² = c²` with the substituted numbers, the squared values and `c = √…`.
- **Squares on every side** (toggleable), with an optional unit grid so students can count cells (9 + 16 = 25).
- **Animated proof** – Euclid's shear → rotate → shear argument (Elements I.47) morphs the two leg squares
  into the two rectangles that exactly fill the hypotenuse square, with step-by-step captions.
- **Reset** to the classic 3-4-5 triangle and one-click Pythagorean triple presets.
- Measurements table (lengths, square areas, angles) and an "area balance" bar chart.
- Fully responsive; the camera smoothly re-frames the figure as it changes.

### Accuracy

Side lengths live on a 0.01 grid, and squares are computed in integer ten-thousandths, so
`a²`, `b²` and `c²` are printed exactly and the on-screen sum always matches digit for digit.
`c` is shown exactly when it lands on the grid (e.g. 5, 13) and as `≈` a 3-decimal value otherwise.

## Branding & fonts

Styled after The Brain Maze logo: coral `#F37367` and navy `#232F5B`, squared corners.
Headings, buttons and labels use the **Brain** typeface (`src/assets/fonts/Brain.woff2`, © Vladimir Nikolic),
which is inlined into the CSS at build time. Brain is capitals-only and has no math symbols, so math
(`a² + b² = c²`, side names) is set in **Saira Semi Condensed**, and any character Brain lacks falls
back to Saira automatically.
